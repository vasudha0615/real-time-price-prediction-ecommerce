# Real-Time Price Prediction for E-Commerce

This project focuses on predicting product prices in an e-commerce platform using
machine learning techniques. The goal is to compare actual prices with predicted
prices and analyze trends over time.

## Project Overview
The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training,
evaluation, and visualization. A Random Forest Regressor is used to predict prices
based on customer behavior and product-related features.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI (for visualization)

## Dataset
The dataset contains e-commerce transaction data including:
- Product category
- Quantity
- Payment method
- Customer behavior features
- Actual price

## Project Workflow
1. Data Loading and Understanding  
2. Data Preprocessing and Encoding  
3. Train-Test Split  
4. Model Training using Random Forest Regressor  
5. Model Evaluation (MAE, MSE, R² Score)  
6. Visualization of Actual vs Predicted Prices using Power BI  

## Model Performance
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~12  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): ~1700  
- R² Score: ~0.99  

## Results
The model performs very well with a high R² score, indicating accurate price
predictions. Visualization helps in comparing actual and predicted prices across
months.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `price_predictions.ipynb`
3. Run all cells in order
